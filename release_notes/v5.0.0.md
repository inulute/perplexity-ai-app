# SimplexityAI v5.0.0

This is the first major release under the **SimplexityAI** name — a complete rebrand and feature overhaul of the former Perplexity AI Desktop App. This release introduces a refreshed identity, a suite of new desktop-native features, and full CI/CD automation for all platforms.

---

## Rebranding

- Renamed from "Perplexity AI App" to **SimplexityAI**
- New app ID: `com.inulute.simplexityai`
- Updated protocol scheme to `simplexity-ai-search://`
- Refreshed color palette and UI theming throughout the application
- New platform-specific icons for Windows (.ico), macOS (.icns), and Linux (.png)
- Automatic settings migration from previous installations — no data loss on upgrade

## New Features

### Find in Page (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F)
A fully integrated find bar for searching text within the loaded page. Appears as a slim overlay at the top of the content area with real-time match highlighting and a live match counter (e.g., "3 / 15"). Navigate between matches with Enter / Shift+Enter or the arrow buttons. Press Escape to close.

### Ctrl+Enter to Send
Optional setting that changes how the Perplexity textarea handles keypresses:
- **Plain Enter** inserts a newline instead of submitting
- **Ctrl+Enter** (or Cmd+Enter on macOS) submits the query
- **Shift+Enter** continues to insert a newline as before

Toggle this on or off in Settings. Disabled by default.

### Zoom Controls
- **Ctrl+= / Cmd+=** to zoom in
- **Ctrl+- / Cmd+-** to zoom out
- **Ctrl+0 / Cmd+0** to reset zoom

Zoom level persists within the session and adjusts the BrowserView content directly.

### Close to Tray
Configurable behavior for the window close button:
- **On (default):** Clicking the X button minimizes the app to the system tray instead of quitting. A one-time notification informs the user on first use.
- **Off:** Clicking the X button quits the application entirely.
